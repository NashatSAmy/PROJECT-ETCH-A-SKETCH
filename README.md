# PROJECT-ETCH-A-SKETCH

My first thought on this project that i was going to use HTML canvas but, when i read the instruction of the project i noticed that they need to mimic a etch a sketch style so i started by making a grid out of divs by using CSS grid and allowed the user to enter their desired size as long as its not bigger than 100*100 next i will set up the drawing function.
